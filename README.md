# Sigma total irregularity of bipartite graphs

We would like to find the bipartite graphs of order n with maximum possible sigma total irregularity. In order to achieve that, do the following:
1. First, for small values of n, find the optimal graphs using a systematic search.
2. Second, try to generalize your findings for larger n and test them well.
3. Make a precise statement as to what the optimal graph(s) will be and test your conjecture
by making small alterations of your candidate(s) â€“ i.e., you should always get a graph with
smaller sigma total irregularity. Here, you can use some metaheuristic.
